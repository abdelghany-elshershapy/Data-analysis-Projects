Enterprise Operational Analytics System
Multi-Unit Performance, Compliance & Workflow Intelligence
1. Project Overview

This project represents the design and implementation of a multi-unit enterprise operational analytics system built using Power BI and dimensional modeling principles.

The objective was to transform fragmented operational Excel-based reporting into a structured, scalable analytical model capable of delivering executive-level insights across four operational units and multiple internal systems.

The solution integrates:

Operational workflows

Approval systems

Compliance monitoring (FRA, SAREQ, QA)

Investigation tracking

Attendance data

Pending system monitoring

Role-based performance metrics

2. Business Context

The organization operates across:

4 operational units

5 internal systems

3 user roles (Maker, Approval, Outsource)

40 total users

The business required:

Unified performance tracking

Pass/Fail/Return/Investigate monitoring

Vendor & NPDD compliance oversight

Unit comparison

Productivity measurement

Risk visibility

Executive summary reporting

The existing structure relied on wide-format Excel sheets with mixed granularity and no centralized data model.

3. Data Architecture & Modeling
Dimensional Model (Star Schema)

The model was redesigned using proper dimensional modeling principles.

Dimension Tables:

Users (user_id, role, unit, approval role indicator)

Systems (system_id, system_name)

Calendar (date, month, day name)

Status (Pass, Failed, Pass REF, Failed REF, Investigate)

Fact Tables:

Unit 1 Performance (daily task completion)

Unit 2 Daily CA1 (operational workflow metrics)

Unit 2 Monthly SAREQ / NPDD (compliance metrics)

Requests for Unit 2 (daily & monthly)

Unit 3 Workflow / Investigation

Unit 4 Achieved Tasks

Attendance (daily employee status)

Pending System tracking

Key modeling decisions:

Clearly defined data grain (daily transactional level where possible)

Separated monthly compliance metrics from daily operational metrics

Avoided many-to-many relationships

Centralized user and calendar dimensions

Created scalable system-based filtering

The ERD reflects controlled 1-to-many relationships between dimension and fact tables, ensuring performance and scalability.

4. KPI Engineering (DAX Layer)

A structured KPI framework was implemented using DAX measures instead of calculated columns.

Core Operational KPIs:

Total Users

Total Units

Total Systems

Total Cases

Total Achieved

Total Pending

Performance KPIs:

Average Completion by Task

Total Completion by Name

Total Pending by Name

Total Cases by User

Total Requests by User Type (Maker vs Outsource)

Compliance KPIs:

Vendor Approved / Rejected / Return

NPDD Approved / Rejected / Return

QA Monitoring Counts

KPI Past Due Tracking

Deferral Monitoring

Risk Metrics:

Investigation Volume

Failed vs Failed REF

Weighted Risk Indicators

Status Distribution Analysis

Advanced DAX techniques used:

CALCULATE

DIVIDE (safe division)

RANKX (user ranking)

Context-based filtering

Aggregation over multiple fact tables

5. Dashboard Design

The dashboard was structured into logical executive blocks:

Executive Summary Layer

Total Users

Total Units

Total Roles

Total Systems

Role-based breakdown

High-level performance indicators

Unit-Level Analysis

Unit 1: Average Completion by Task

Unit 2: Total Cases & User Filtering

Unit 3: Pending & Comments Monitoring

Unit 4: Total Achieved by System

Performance Analytics

Completion by Name

Pending by Name

Case Distribution by User

Request Type Distribution

Status Breakdown (Pass, Pass REF, Investigate, Failed, Failed REF)

The design allows:

Day filtering

Month filtering

System filtering

User-level drill-down

Unit-level comparison

6. Key Improvements Made During Development

During development, several architectural improvements were implemented:

Converted wide Excel sheets into structured fact tables

Unified Pass/Failed/Investigate into standardized status metrics

Introduced system-level classification

Integrated attendance with productivity tracking

Implemented centralized date filtering

Separated volume metrics from compliance metrics

Designed model to support future SQL backend integration

7. Business Value Simulation

This system enables:

Identification of high-risk users

Unit-level performance comparison

Compliance monitoring across Vendor and NPDD workflows

Early detection of investigation spikes

Visibility into pending workload

Role-based productivity analysis

Executive-ready reporting

8. Technical Stack

Excel (initial structuring)

Power Query (data transformation & normalization)

Power BI (data modeling & visualization)

DAX (measure engineering)

Dimensional Modeling principles

9. What This Project Demonstrates

This project demonstrates:

Strong understanding of data modeling principles

Ability to move from raw Excel to enterprise-ready BI model

KPI engineering mindset

Multi-table relationship management

Analytical problem solving

Executive dashboard design

Scalability-focused architecture thinking

This is not just a dashboard — it is a structured enterprise analytics system.
