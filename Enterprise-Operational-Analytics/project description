# 🚀 Enterprise Operational Analytics System  
### Multi-Unit Performance, Compliance & Workflow Intelligence

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project represents the end-to-end design and implementation of a **multi-unit enterprise operational analytics system** built using Power BI and dimensional modeling principles.

The objective was to transform fragmented Excel-based operational reporting into a **structured, scalable analytical model** capable of delivering executive-level insights across multiple units and systems.

This solution integrates operational workflows, compliance tracking, investigations, attendance, and system monitoring into a unified BI architecture.

---

## 🏢 Business Context

The simulated organization operates across:

- **4 Operational Units**
- **5 Internal Systems**
- **3 Core Roles** (Maker, Approval, Outsource)
- **40 Total Users**

The business required:

- Unified performance tracking
- Pass / Fail / Return / Investigate monitoring
- Vendor & NPDD compliance oversight
- Unit-level comparison
- Attendance vs productivity tracking
- Pending workload visibility
- Executive-level reporting dashboard

The original data existed in wide Excel sheets with mixed granularity and no centralized structure, limiting scalability and analytical depth.

## 🧠 Data Architecture & Modeling

### 📊 Dimensional Model (Star Schema)

The model was redesigned using proper dimensional modeling principles to ensure scalability and performance.

### 🔹 Dimension Tables

- `Users` (user_id, name, role, unit)
- `Systems` (system_id, system_name)
- `Calendar` (date, month, day_name)
- `Status` (Pass, Failed, Pass REF, Failed REF, Investigate)

### 🔹 Fact Tables

- Unit 1 – Daily Task Completion
- Unit 2 – Daily CA1 Workflow Metrics
- Unit 2 – Monthly SAREQ / NPDD Compliance Metrics
- Unit 2 – Requests (Daily & Monthly)
- Unit 3 – Workflow & Investigation Tracking
- Unit 4 – Achieved Tasks
- Attendance Tracking
- Pending System Monitoring

### 🔹 Key Modeling Decisions

- Defined clear data grain (daily where possible)
- Converted wide Excel structures into normalized format
- Centralized calendar dimension for consistent filtering
- Avoided many-to-many relationships
- Separated operational metrics from compliance metrics
- Designed for future SQL integration

The ERD reflects controlled one-to-many relationships between dimensions and fact tables, ensuring model stability and performance.

## 📈 KPI Engineering (DAX Layer)

All performance indicators were implemented using **DAX measures**, not calculated columns, to maintain dynamic filtering and aggregation flexibility.

### 🔹 Core KPIs

- Total Users
- Total Units
- Total Roles
- Total Systems
- Total Cases
- Total Achieved
- Total Pending

### 🔹 Operational Performance KPIs

- Average Completion by Task
- Total Completion by Name
- Total Pending by Name
- Total Cases by User
- Total Requests by User Type (Maker vs Outsource)

### 🔹 Compliance & QA KPIs

- Vendor Approved / Rejected / Return
- NPDD Approved / Rejected / Return
- QA Monitoring Metrics
- KPI Past Due Tracking
- Deferral Monitoring

### 🔹 Risk & Investigation Metrics

- Investigation Volume
- Failed vs Failed REF
- Weighted Risk Score
- Status Distribution Analysis

### 🔹 Advanced DAX Techniques Used

- `CALCULATE`
- `DIVIDE`
- `RANKX`
- Context transition & filter context control
- Aggregation across multiple fact tables

## 📊 Dashboard Design

The dashboard is structured into executive-ready analytical sections:

### 🟢 Executive Summary Layer

- Total Users
- Total Units
- Total Roles
- Total Systems
- High-level performance indicators
- Role-based distribution

### 🟡 Unit-Level Analysis

- Unit 1: Average Completion by Task
- Unit 2: Total Cases & User Filtering
- Unit 3: Pending & Comments Monitoring
- Unit 4: Total Achieved by System

### 🔵 Performance Analytics

- Completion by Name
- Pending by Name
- Case Distribution by User
- Request Type Breakdown
- Status Distribution (Pass, Pass REF, Investigate, Failed, Failed REF)

The dashboard supports:

- Day-level filtering
- Month-level filtering
- System-based filtering
- User drill-down
- Unit comparison
